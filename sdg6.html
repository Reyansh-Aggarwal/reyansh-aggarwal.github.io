          </h1>
          <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            By 2030, ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. The targets include achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water, and adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all. It focuses on improving water quality by reducing pollution, minimizing the release of hazardous chemicals, and increasing water-use efficiency. The goal also emphasizes protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems, and expanding international cooperation and capacity-building support to developing countries in water and sanitation-related activities. Additionally, it aims to support and strengthen the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management.

            None of the SDG 6 targets are on track to be met. As of 2022, 2.2 billion people were without access to safely managed drinking water and 3.5 billion lacked access to safely managed sanitation. Between 2002 and 2021 droughts affected more than 1.4 billion people. Roughly half of the world’s population experienced severe water scarcity for at least part of the year, while one quarter faced ‘extremely high’ levels of water stress. Climate change worsens these issues, posing significant risks to social stability. While transboundary river and lake basins are home to approximately 40% of the world’s population and are shared by 153 countries, less than a fifth of these countries have operational arrangements for cooperation in place for all their transboundary waters. Coordinated global action on integrated water management, addressing the impacts of climate change on water resources, and better management of shared waters are key to restoring focus on the Goal.</p>
